Hello,

This example blog connects to the JSON placeholder API and fetches data to imitate an infinite-scrolling blog site. This project was very handy in furthering my skills in javascript as well as interacting with different APIs. 

To run this yourself, git clone or download all the files into a single directory and run through the live server app on vscode or node.
